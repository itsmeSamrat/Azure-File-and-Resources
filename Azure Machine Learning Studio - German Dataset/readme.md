## Description

This is part 2 of 2 part assignment. My partner did the part 1. I will be explaining the part 2 which is to develop a predictive analytical solution for identifying good or bad credit using German Credit Data. Also, after creating the model, we will be deploying it as Azure Machine Learning web services.

Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio provides us easy to use drag and drop functionality for training a model. We just follow the steps we normally do in a normal machine learning project. We can import the data, edit the metadata, find missing values, duplicate values, outlier handling, normalize the data, split the data, train, test and evaluate the model, build a model, with just a click of a button.

At the end of the video, after the deployment, we receive API keys with that, we will be able to use the model any where easily with our code.

Its a easy fun way of training the model and deploying the model too. 

Please watch the video uploaded for more details, if you are interested in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio.
