## Description

We will be looking into Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.

The cognitive services aim to bring the AI within the reach of every developer and data scientist with a simple API call to solve the problems in the field of artificial intelligence we can embed the service into our apps or website, and we are ready to go.

In the project, we are creating a cognitive image classification service which classify sneakers images. Nowadays, the image classification is highly used in different fields like object detection. This will be an example of that.
To challenging the classifier and to test how accurate the image classification of Microsoft is, we will be using similar sneakers images. They are:

1. Nike
2. Reebok
3. Puma
4. Adidas
