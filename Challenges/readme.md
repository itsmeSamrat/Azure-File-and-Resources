[Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Description

This directory contains series of Challenges which were given by our professor. This helps us to get our understanding and foundation solid towards Azure. We learned how to create and connect the SQL database, how data factory work and how it can transfer files/data, creating simple drag and drop models with Azure Machine Learning and finally, overview of all the cognitive services.

The challenges are fun and simple. Give it a try. 😊

Thank You.
